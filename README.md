Add abstract here

## Requirements

We have provided a `requirements.txt` file which lists the required libraries. You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

There are two notebooks in this repository:

1. make_dataset.ipynb
2. fine_tune_rag.ipynb

We recommended running the notebooks in the order listed above. make_dataset.ipynb is used to acquire the index data from wikipedia while fine_tune_rag.ipynb is used to fine-tune the RAG model and perform some simple analysis.
